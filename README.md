Future transportation will either be a refinement of current tech or a completely new innovation obviously. After all, current transportation methods were once the figment of someones imagination Transportation in the future will come in various interesting forms

ransportation methods is nuclear-powered cars They are a well defined concept in scifi notable examples including the Fallout series of games Safety concerns and misunderstandings of the different forms of nuclear technology aside, they could be a reality in the future  Believe it or not there is an American company who are powering ahead with their ambition to bring them to reality Laser Power Systems LPS have been touting the benefits of thorium  The radioactive element largely responsible for powering the Earth's core
and i'm really interested in time traviling soo Chinese physicists were able to transport a photon 16 and 100 km in 2011 or  2012 idk.. respectively Clearly this technology in scifi and realit will be able transport an object from A to B but not in its original form The original is destroyed and rebuilt at the destination
This clearly has many ethical and moral implications not to mention logistical complexities to overcome If they could do this would the new object or person at the destination actually be you or a clone Can we ever justify killin someone in this way Would you even use this future transportation method
 top new vehicle and technology for transportation in the future
EN-V car: is a two seater urban electric car meant to be driven manually  via ia.. and the creators joined together to develop the technolagy in june 2014.. and the main draw of this vehicle is the autopilot feature that allowes the electric car to drive by it self
